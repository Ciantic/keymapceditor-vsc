# QMKMapper VSCode Extension

Allows to preview and edit [QMK Firmaware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) keymap.c files from VSCode.

This is very much work in progress. Most of the code can be found from the [QMKMapper](https://github.com/Ciantic/qmkmapper) repository, this repository contains only the VSCode extension.
